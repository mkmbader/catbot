# CatBot
Meet CatBot - the c(h)atbot who know's all about Cats, based on [simple wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat). Catbot's gives a quick start guide to RAG evaluation and was developped to fuel a presentation at PyData Amsterdam 2025.

### Overview
This `main.py` notebook contains the following workflow:

- **Database Creation**: Initializes a database using ChromaDB to efficiently store and retrieve data.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) QA System**: Builds a question-answering system that queries the database using RAG techniques.
- **Synthetic Dataset Generation**: Utilizes Ragas with a custom prompt to generate a synthetic dataset tailored for QA tasks.
- **Automated Evaluation**: Assesses the QA systemâ€™s responses using Ragas-provided evaluation metrics such as Faithfulness, Answer Correctness, Answer Relevancy
