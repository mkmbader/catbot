      "Response:  Cats have been domesticated for nearly 10,000 years. The oldest evidence of cats kept as pets is from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, around 7500 BC. In the past, mostly in Egypt, people kept cats because they hunted and ate mice and rats. Ancient Egyptians worshipped cats as gods and often mummified them so they could be with their owners \"for all of eternity\". Cats started becoming pets during the time of the ancient Egyptians. Today, people often keep cats as pets, and some domestic cats live without care from people as feral or stray cats.\n",

      "Reference:  Cats have an anatomy similar to other members of the genus Felis, including extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae, which contribute to their exceptional flexibility. Additionally, their front paws are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones, allowing them to pass their bodies through any space their heads can fit into. This flexibility and precise walking gait, including a unique pacing gait, enhance their mobility and hunting skills, especially for catching small rodents, which is reflected in their narrowly spaced canine teeth adapted for this prey. However, cats kept indoors most of the time are protected from dangers such as fleas, which outdoor cats commonly encounter. Indoor cats are safer from external threats but may become overweight due to lack of exercise and overfeeding, especially after being spayed or neutered, although neutering can increase their lifespan. Thus, while their anatomy supports their natural hunting abilities, indoor living improves their safety but requires attention to their health and activity levels.\n",

      "Contexts:  ['Cat - Anatomy\\n\\nCats have anatomy similar to the other members of the genus Felis. The genus has extra lumbar (lower back) and thoracic (chest) vertebrae. This helps explain why cats are very flexible. Unlike human arms, cat\\'s front paws are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones. These allow cats to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their heads.\\nThe cat skull, unlike most mammals, has very large eye sockets and a powerful jaw. Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth: this is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents. Cats, like dogs, walk directly on their toes, with the bones of their feet making up the lower part of the visible leg.\\nCats walk very precisely. Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a \"pacing\" gait (walking style); that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This trait is shared with camels and giraffes. As a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat\\'s gait will change to be a \"diagonal\" gait, similar to that of most other mammals: the diagonally opposite hind and forelegs will move at the same time. Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. On the inside of the front paws there is something which looks like a sixth \"finger\". This special feature on the inside of the wrists is the carpal pad. The carpal pad is also found on other cats and on dogs.']\n"

      "Question:  How does the unique anatomy of cats, such as their extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae and free-floating clavicle bones, contribute to their flexibility and hunting abilities, and how does keeping cats indoors impact their safety and health?\n",
      "Response:  Cats' unique anatomy, including extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae, contributes to their high flexibility. This flexibility allows them to move easily and fit their bodies through any space into which they can fit their heads. Additionally, their front paws are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones, which further aid in their ability to pass through tight spaces. These anatomical features support cats' hunting abilities by enabling precise and agile movements necessary for catching small prey like rodents.\n",
